## Description

This repository is the projects that were required to complete during CSS343. These are essential programs to teach the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms. This class mainly focused in coding in C++. 

It also contains small exercises that were done to build a foundation of knowledge of concepts we learned in class. 

## Assignments

Turtleprogram -- This project implements a dynamic array that sizes an array depending on the number of strings added. The purpose of this project is to take in a set of commands and analyze those commands. 

BST -- Binary Search Tree Implementation

Graph -- Graph Data Structure Implementation Project

Movies -- This project utilizes polymorphism and has many files communicating with one another. It takes in a set of movies and stores them and a set of customers and there ID's. It also stores commands and analyzes the commands to tell what movies were borrowed and returned. It also gives an inventory of how many of a specific type of movie remains and even the full extensive history on that movie. 

## Exercises 

50 Unix -- This exercise has 50 questions on different linux/command line commands that are handy when programming. 

Fix Factorial -- This program required fixing a facotorial program and optimizing it. 

Memory Leak -- This program was to ensure good coding practices. It was emphasized in this class that memory leaks need to be fixed. This exercise required fixing 4 memory leak issues. Each harder than the last.
